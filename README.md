### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a hydrologist working at [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu/) [Research Applications Lab](https://ral.ucar.edu/). 

I work at the junction of physical and statistical hydrology using [WRF-Hydro/National Water Model](https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_nwm_public/) and data assimilation frameworks like [DART](https://github.com/NCAR/DART/) and [JEDI/OOPS](https://github.com/JCSDA/oops/). I focus on simulating and forecasting streamflow and snow pack. I am also interested in the relationship of water and soil carbon. 

My [scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IxbQ-68AAAAJ&hl=en).

I'm currently working on (updated sporadically):
  * JEDI implementation of NOAA's National Water Model (private development)
  * [A Wavelet-Based Approach to Streamflow Event Identification and Modeled Timing Error Evaluation - preprint in HESS](https://hess.copernicus.org/preprints/hess-2020-323/)
  * Ensemble Streamflow Data Assimilation using WRF-Hydro and DART: Hurricane Florence Flooding (submitted to HESS)
  * [Parameter Estimation in Ungaged Basins using Simulated SWOT Discharge Observations](https://www.essoar.org/doi/abs/10.1002/essoar.10506002.1)
  * [Managed Aquifer Recharge Suitability Mapping: "Project Beaver"](https://github.com/earthshot-labs/water)
